# Python-based Collision Simulator with Balls

## Description

The Collision Simulator with Balls is a Python project that offers an interactive and visually appealing experience to explore the behavior of collisions between balls in a virtual environment. This simulator utilizes the Pygame library for graphical representation and provides various features for simulating and visualizing ball interactions.

## Key Features

1. **Motion Simulation:** Simulate the motion of balls according to velocity vectors, considering interactions with other balls and environment boundaries.

2. **Collision Detection:** Efficient algorithm for detecting collisions between balls, applying the laws of physics to calculate new directions and speeds.

3. **Graphical Visualization:** Utilizes Pygame for an attractive graphical representation of the moving balls and collisions. Customize ball appearance with different colors and styles.
